# Assembly Bug: Potential Buffer Overflow
This repository demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in a short assembly code snippet. The bug lies in the `mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]` instruction, where the value of `ecx` is not properly checked, leading to potential out-of-bounds memory access.

## Bug Description
The `mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]` instruction accesses memory at the address calculated by `ebx + ecx * 4`. If `ecx` is a large enough value, the calculated address could point outside the bounds of the allocated memory, causing a buffer overflow. This can lead to unpredictable program behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

## Solution
The solution involves adding a check before the `mov` instruction to ensure that `ecx` does not exceed a safe value. This check could involve comparing `ecx` to the size of the buffer and throwing an error if it's too large.  The implementation of this check depends heavily on the surrounding code and context. 

This example highlights the importance of careful memory management in assembly programming and demonstrates how unchecked input can lead to security risks.
